Minimal binding to _memcached_.

To compile, you need to have libmemcached-dev installed:

 foo$ sudo apt-get install libmemcached-dev
 # Not to be confused with (lib)memcache; a dated impl.

To use/test/run, you need to have a memcached server running. On e.g.,
localhost,

 foo$ sudo apt-get install memcached

(Tweak to fit if you install packages without using apt-get or
 are on something not Debian based.)
